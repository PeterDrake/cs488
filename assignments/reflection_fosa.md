# Festival of Scholars and Artists

Attend (or give!) at least three presentations at the Festival of Scholars and Artists.

## What to Hand in

For each one, write one paragraph summarizing the presentation and a second paragraph connecting the presentation to this course. If you're coming up dry on those second paragraphs, here are some questions to get your creative juices flowing:

- What software was used in this project? 
- What software could have been used? 
- What special challenges would there be in developing such software? 
- How is the process of this project analogous to, or contrasting with, the software development process?
- Does this project raise issues that software developers should take into account in their work?
