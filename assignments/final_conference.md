# Final Conference

Provide feedback (through the form linked in the assignment on Google Classroom) for each of your teammates.

Make [an appointment](https://calendar.app.google/Q9xY6qLg96KNtzFJA) to meet with me to discuss your final grade.

Be prepared to discuss what [grade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xXvmiHJB66jHNd4ZFUIw1FyP-7K8a1wr882bVuA3naM/edit?usp=sharing) you should have for the class and why.

Note that "I showed up for class and completed the assignments" is a good case for a B. If you want to argue for an A, you need to tell me how you went above and beyond. See the grade document linked above (scroll down below the table) for some ways you might have done this.
