# Final Conference

Provide feedback (through the form linked in the assignment on Google Classroom) for each of your teammates.

Make [an appointment](https://calendar.app.google/Q9xY6qLg96KNtzFJA) to meet with me to discuss your final grade.

Be prepared to discuss what [grade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xXvmiHJB66jHNd4ZFUIw1FyP-7K8a1wr882bVuA3naM/edit?usp=sharing) you should have for the class and why.

Note that "I showed up for class and completed the assignments" is a good case for a B. If you want to argue for an A, you need to tell me how you went above and beyond. For this class in particular you probably did plenty of "above and beyond" learning about specific tools and concepts for your project, but you need to communicate that to me.
