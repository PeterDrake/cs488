# Reflection

Look back over your notes ***for the semester*** and write a 1-2 page (single-spaced) reflection on what you have learned, or what you problems you encountered, in this class and associated readings.

This should be an essay, not a bulleted list or stream-of-consciousness padding. I want you to have thought about the material and experiences in this class, have something to say, and communicate successfully. These will be extremely valuable skills for the rest of your life!
