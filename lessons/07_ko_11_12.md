# Discussion of Ko 11-12
* Team Discussions
  * The number of possible inputs to a function can be enormous or even infinite. How can you reasonably test such a function?
  * Suppose, after delivering a version of your software at the end of an iteration, you got to watch your customer use it. What might you look for?

* Customer meeting
  * General-purpose feedback
    * One team succeeded in making a working Mac build
  * Re-estimate stories
  * Choosing stories for the iteration
  * Planning
    * Different pairs this time!
* Code
  * The first time a team has a pull request, let me know and we'll demonstrate a code review together
    * What new behavior is claimed by this code?
    * Do all the tests pass?
    * Are there any new tests? If not, how can the new behavior be verified?
    * Does this code work when integrated into the system?
    * Are there possible improvements to the code?
