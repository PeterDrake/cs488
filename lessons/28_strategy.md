# Strategy
* Problem: You want to provide several variants of an algorithm without bloating your class.
  * Example from Refactoring Guru: route planning for car, walking, mass transit, biking...
* Solution: Make a class for each strategy. They all implement a common interface.
* [Pros and cons](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)
  * TPS: In Python, how could you avoid defining a class for each strategy?
  * Example: key argument to sorted

# Iteration 5
* Code
* Produce final build!
* Make sure it's well-documented
  * How to run it
  * How it's organized (for whoever has to maintain it)
