# Git

Walk through steps on [Pythonorama git](NEED URL), with everyone following in lock step using `student` account:
* Installation verification
  * Install nano or another text editor first
* Configuration
* Creating a repo and initial commit
* Committing
* Working with past commits (log, checkout)
* Branches
* Don't talk about remote repos yet

Mistakes
* Forgetting to add a file
  * If you changed nothing else, trying to commit does nothing
  * If you did change something else, committing does not save the file in question in the repo
    * It can’t be reverted to past versions that were never committed
    * Other people won’t be able to get to it
* Changing branches when you haven’t committed yet
  * If you’ve changed a file that would be affected, git tells you to commit your changes first
* Committing again after a failed merge (without resolving the conflict)
  * Git will complain that there is an unresolved conflict
* Committing in detached HEAD state
  * Works, but branch has no name until you give it one
