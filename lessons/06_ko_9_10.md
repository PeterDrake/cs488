* Team Discussions
  * Which of the numbered questions in chapter 10 can be answered by your IDE? How?

* Install the pyinstaller package
* In terminal (within PyCharm) do `pyinstaller -F src/adder.py`
* The application should be in `dist`
  * Copy it to the desktop and try to run it
    * Linux: right click, run as program
    * Windows: double click?
    * MacOS: double click?
  * Pyinstaller produces a build for the OS you're on

# Iteration 2

* Email me a standalone Mac build
